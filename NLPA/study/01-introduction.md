# 01. Introduction to NLP Applications

## Overview

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves processing, understanding, and generating natural language data.

## Key Applications

NLP has a wide range of applications in today's digital world:

1.  **Machine Translation (MT)**: automatically translating text or speech from one language to another (e.g., Google Translate).
2.  **Information Retrieval (IR)**: Finding relevant documents or information based on a user query (e.g., Search Engines).
3.  **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone behind a body of text (e.g., analyzing customer reviews).
4.  **Information Extraction (IE)**: Extracting structured information from unstructured text (e.g., Named Entity Recognition).
5.  **Question Answering (QA)**: Building systems that automatically answer questions posed by humans in a natural language (e.g., Siri, Alexa).
6.  **Text Summarization**: generating a concise summary of a longer text document.
7.  **Chatbots & Conversational AI**: Systems that can converse with humans.

## Challenges in NLP

-   **Ambiguity**: Language is inherently ambiguous.
    -   *Lexical Ambiguity*: Words having multiple meanings (e.g., "bank").
    -   *Syntactic Ambiguity*: Sentences having multiple parse trees (e.g., "I saw the man with the telescope").
    -   *Semantic Ambiguity*: Sentences having multiple meanings based on context.
-   **Context Dependence**: The meaning of words and sentences often depends on the surrounding context.
-   **Slang, Idioms, and Neologisms**: Language is constantly evolving.
-   **World Knowledge**: Understanding language often requires knowledge about the real world.
